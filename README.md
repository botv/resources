# Resources

- Doppler (http://dopplers.com) lets you manage your environment variables in the cloud. Instead of storing everything in .env files and configuring individual cloud providers, you can sync secrets across environments securely using Doppler. Huge shoutout to @vallelungabrian!

- The Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide (https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) is all you need to take yourself to the next level as a JS developer. The importance of clean code can't be overstated, especially in larger projects.

- GitHub (http://github.com) is essential for code collaboration. (To more experienced devs out there, you'd be surprised; people still write code in Google Docs.)

- Firebase (http://firebase.google.com) is a great way to get started with authentication, databases, and cloud storage. It's basically like AWS or GCP without all the complicated parts, so it's a great way to get started.

- JetBrains (http://jetbrains.com) is the best IDE out there. If you're using VSCode, Sublime, or Atom, you're missing out on all the amazing conveniences of using an IDE.

- Twilio (http://twilio.com) is what everyone uses for SMS these days. All those Discord bots you see in groups that send text messages to members? They use Twilio.

- Next.js (http://nextjs.org) is what every website should and will be written in. It's basically React without all the mystery, and it makes everything much faster. 
@timneutkens is the most innovative player in OSS right now as far as I'm concerned.

- Animate.css (http://animate.style) is a way to add CSS animations to your web project in under 30 seconds. When it comes to animation, this is the place to start.

- Font Awesome (https://fontawesome.com) is the easiest way to add beautiful icons to any project. I highly recommend investing in the pro package if you're particularly design-oriented; I couldn't be happier with it myself.

- TailwindCSS (https://tailwindcss.com) will completely replace Bootstrap within the next ten years. Huge shoutout to @adamwathan, the guy is a genius.

- SWR (https://swr.vercel.app) is a "React Hooks library for data fetching." Discovering this library was one of the happiest moments of my life. Shoutout to 
@shuding_ for singlehandedly changing the way data is fetched from the frontend.

- discord.js (http://discord.js.org) is the only thing you need to build Discord bots in JavaScript.

- ESLint (http://eslint.org) is pretty much all you need to make sure you're not writing terrible code (and it plays nice with Airbnb's style guide as well!)
